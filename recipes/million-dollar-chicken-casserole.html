        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Creamy and incredibly savory, it's a casserole that's hard to stop eating. The cottage cheese is the trick to getting such a creamy, melty texture. Using rotisserie chicken is a must for the recipe and helps keep it quick.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can cream of chicken soup</li>
            <li>1 cups cottage cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon Creole seasoning</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons garlic powder, divided</li>
            <li>5 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
            <li>1 cups finely chopped yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>30 buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®), crushed</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons sliced scallions, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stir together cream of chicken soup, cottage cheese, sour cream, cream cheese, Creole seasoning, onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of the garlic powder in a medium bowl until well blended and smooth. Fold in chicken, chopped onion, and parsley until evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Stir together crackers, melted butter, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Spoon chicken mixture evenly into an 11x7-inch or 9-inch square baking dish. Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella then cracker mixture.</li>
            <li>Place on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until crackers are golden brown and edges are bubbly, about 40 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving; garnish with scallions if desired.</li>
